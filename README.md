# cj.cafe

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website.
It contains an overview of who I am, a blog, a word game, and some miscellanous demos.
This website was built to be responsibe, so every page should work well on both mobile and larger screens.

## Deploying to AWS

Prerequisites:
- Update terraform files to match your domain name, AWS region, docker image, etc
- Authenticate Terraform with AWS via terraform login

### Create prerequites AWS resources
In AWS Route53, create a hosted zone for the domain name you want to use, if it does not already exist.
In main.tf, update the route53 record names to match this domain (eg name = "cj.cafe" -> name = "your-domain.com")
This applies regardless of whether AWS is your domain registrar or not.
If AWS is not your domain registrar, you will need to update the nameservers in your domain registrar to match the ones in the AWS hosted zone.


### Run terraform
terraform -chdir=tf init
terraform -chdir=tf plan
terraform -chdir=tf apply

## TODO:
- Configure load balancer to be useful
- Test that load balancer actually routes traffic and provides high availability
- Separate tf.main into separate files, one for each group of resources
- Use tf local state instead of hardcoding domain name
